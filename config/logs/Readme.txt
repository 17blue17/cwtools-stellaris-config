Update the log files whenever new effects/triggers/modifiers are added.

Just copy-paste from logs/scripting_documentation, and then combine effects.log and triggers.log into trigger_docs.log
Warning - for the effects and triggers Paradox default logs have had errors.  It is best not to simply copy and paste but win merge the new items after making sure they make sense.

Be sure there is an empty newline at the end of the *.log files

IMPORTANT: after updating please make sure to test by running cwtools and do view menu, output, then in the drop down select paradox language server.  Make sure there is no error about the logs or the logs not found.   If there is an error bring it to Dayshine's attention.
