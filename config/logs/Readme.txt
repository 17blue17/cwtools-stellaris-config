Update the log files whenever new effects/triggers/modifiers are added.

Just copy-paste from logs/scripting_documentation, and then combine effects.log and triggers.log into trigger_docs.log

Be sure there is an empty newline at the end of the *.log files

IMPORTANT: after updating please make sure to test by running cwtools and do view menu, output, then in the drop down select paradox language server.  Make sure there is no error about the logs or the logs not found.   If there is an error bring it to Dayshine's attention.   It has been erroring out at line 1931.  Hopefully this will not keep happening because if it does then cwtools has no scopes for triggers or effects.
